            <div class="paragraph">Accessibility was one of our important point whilst working on this website. To make it more accessible we used the "principles of universal design". This principle contains 7 important points: 
                <ul>
                    <li>Equitable Use</li>
                    <li>Flexibility use</li>
                    <li>Simple and Intuitive Use</li>
                    <li>Perceptible Information</li>
                    <li>Tolerance for Error</li>
                    <li>Low Physical Effort</li>
                    <li>Appropriate Size and Space for Approach and Use</li>

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
            <p class="paragraph">This page will briefly explain how we use different tags for HTML/CSS, so that we can make this webpage accessible for every vister.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                <b>Creating links:</b> To create a link, we used the HTML tag <em>a</em>. We used them in our navigation bar and severeal places around the webpage. This links directs you to another page or website.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
            <b>Use of div/span: </b> 
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
            <b>Use of javascript</b>: This was used for the navigation/responsive menubar, to make it mobile friendly. Otherwise it was not in use in other cases.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
            <b>Use of p:</b>
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
            <b>Use of b/strong</b>: this was used for important words
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
            <b>Use of @media screen in CSS:</b> This is used to make the webpage mobile friendly, so that mobile users could use the website without any concerns.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">When we started building this website, all we thought accessibility was about is to make sure almost every screen, whether it’s a smart watch screen, or the largest screen in Time Square, could show the content clearly without any problem. And that’s what we have been working on mostly since the beginning. In order to make it easy for the upcoming developers to understand the code, we have named the different classes with things that makes sense, for example: row, title, paragraph, menu, menuCard, menuBar, …etc. Such classes helped us avoid repetition in designing new things that are already designed before, which makes the CSS designing code as short and specific as possible. 
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">Afterward, in a bit late time, we found out that we wanted our website to be usable to as many users as possible. By a coincidence, we thought that even blind people should be able to use our website. By adding description to pictures in HTML, any voice reader could use it to tell the user what is there. Unfortunately, due to short time, we’ve just applied this to images in the Menu Page, and not the other pages. On the other side, we think that out website is pretty flexible, and we would reuse it in future projects.
            </p>
            <h1 class="title">Automated deployment</h1>
            <p class="paragraph">After we were done with the code, we took a test by creating a Jekyll-docker.yml file on Github, and it ran fine, but we were not able to deploy the website anyway due to some errors related to Github itself. Instead, we’ve made a Zip-file to avoid errors related to websites looking ugly when they are unzipped. </p>
