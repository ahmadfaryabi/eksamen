            <p class="paragraph">
                Before Corona existed, people used to meet up to do all different types of tasks, whether to work or study. Programs and other helping tools for digital communication existed, yet they were not used a lot because there was less need for them back then.
            </p>
            <h1 class="title" id="par_2">During Corona.</h1>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Overall lockdown, caused by the Corona crisis, made people to stay unconnected physically. Though there were other options that were accessible for the individuals and the companies. Online meetings became an option for those who needed it, for example, Apps like Zoom, Skype, Microsoft Teams, … became very popular to finish the job.
            </p>
            <h1 class="title" id="par_3">After Corona (Present and future).</h1>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Physical meeting became possible again in 2021, however, there were still need for a digital way of contact. We can consider this type of meeting as a very huge innovation, and even a revolution. It was something new, useful and implemented, and helped the world not to stop completely because of the crisis. It also didn’t thoroughly replace the typical 
                way of meeting, but instead it became an alternative.     
            </p>

            <h1 class="title" id="feedback">Universal Design from our perspective</h1>
            <p class="paragraph">Mainly, the first and foremost goal in developing products is to solve a problem, whether it was general, or it is specified for one customer. When a programmer is asked to solve a certain problem, not only a solution will be found necessarily, but the programmer is also required to meet all types of needs that a customer would have. </p>
            <p class="paragraph">Example on that is the design. In the video, a design of a photo writer was changed from red to yellow, because the red color reminded the farmers, whom are the actual users, with mouses, which we can consider as an enemy to them farmers. From that, can we deduce that not only the essence of the solution matters, but even also how the solution looks like. </p>
            <p class="paragraph">It matters that when you see a color, a logo, or anything that is designed, you feel comfortable, and the key of knowing the right result you will provide, so you should have your customer's interaction, and without it, you are risking failing. We cannot assume that design and data are separate. Data deals with codes that are hidden behind what is visual. Design is what is visible that everyone can see. For programming or something else that is made to be done, it must be completely clear with both coding that is not visible how it is coded and with the design that you can see when the product is absolutely finished. </p>
            <p class="paragraph">If the design is not well made, then the product will not be attractive or if there is an error in the code then the program will not be stainable. This means that design and our study, which is computer engineering, are completely adjacent to each other. A small illustration can summarize everything:</p>
